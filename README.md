# This is a repository for my replication paper in Q1 of:
Little, Andrew T., and Anne Meng. 2024. “Measuring Democratic Backsliding.” PS: Political
Science & Politics 57 (2): 149–61. https://doi.org/10.1017/S104909652300063X.

As you can see, I have uploaded both the replication code of the original paper and the replication code of my own replication of the paper.
I have also uploaded the data files needed to run the whole code until the end.
At the bottom of the code, you will find the part of my replication.
